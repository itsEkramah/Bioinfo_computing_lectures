"""
Type casting = converting one data type into another
    int()   → convert to integer
    float() → convert to decimal
    str()   → convert to string

Example:
    age = int(input("Enter age: "))    # converts input (string) to integer
    marks = float(input("Enter marks: "))  # converts input to float
