"""Topic 3: Loops in Python
🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this topic, you should confidently handle:

for and while loops

range() function

break, continue, and pass

Nested loops

The while...else and for...else blocks

Common loop-based logic (factorial, sum, reverse number, pattern printing, etc.)"""


# for i in range(3):
#     print( "Python" ,  end="  " )
#     ###end" "  ka use krnay se same line main print hota warna  hrr row main 1 baar 


# for i in range(2, 10, 3):
#     print(i)

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)
# ###print  apple banana cherry in seperate rows 

# i = 1
# while i <= 5:
#     print(i)
#     # i =+ 1   infinite loop of printing 1
#     i +=1     ##   print 1-5 in rows 


# break

# # Stops loop immediately.
# for i in range(5):
#     if i == 3:
#         break
#     print(i)
# ## 0 1 2 print ho gaa seperate rows main hio
# q k loop jese hi 3 k equalhoa brak ho gea aur 3 ki value i main aai hi nahii


# continue

# Skips current iteration and moves to next.
# for i in range(5):
#     if i == 2:
#         continue
#     print(i)


# pass

# Does nothing (placeholder for future logic).
for i in range(3):
    pass
