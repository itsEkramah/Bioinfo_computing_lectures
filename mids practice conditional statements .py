# CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
# 🩵 1️⃣ The if, elif, else Structure

# Conditional statements help your program make decisions based on conditions (True/False). Nested if Statements

# You can put an if inside another if.
# Used when decisions depend on multiple layers of logic.

# 🔹 Example
# age = 20
# citizen = True

# if age >= 18:
#     if citizen:
#         print("Eligible to vote")
#     else:
#         print("Not eligible - not a citizen")
# else:
#     print("Not eligible - underage")


# marks=int(input("enter marks:"))
# if marks >=80 :
#     print(" your grade is A")
# elif marks>=60:
#     print ("ur grade is B")
# elif marks>=50:
#     print(" your grade is C")
# else:
#     print("you are fail")
